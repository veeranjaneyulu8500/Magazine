<p>A Magazine is a periodical publications, generally published on a regular schedule(often weekly or monthly),containing a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, purchase price, prepaid Subscriptions, or by a combination of the three.
</p>

    <p>This is the model used by many trade magazines (industry-based periodicals) distributed only to qualifying readers, often for free and determined by some form of survey. Because of costs (e.g., printing and postage) associated with the medium of print, publishers may not distribute free copies to everyone who requests one (unqualified leads); instead, they operate under controlled circulation, deciding who may receive free subscriptions based on each person's qualification as a member of the trade</p>
    
    <h3>What is RIP</h3>
    <p>R.I.P. means “Rest in peace” in English and “Requiescat in pace” in Latin. The Latin phrase was originally used by early Christians in the catacombs and on tombstones before the fifth century. It was a prayer or wish for the soul of the deceased to find peace in the afterlife, particularly in Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist traditions.</p>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation</p>
    <p>In Magazine, each element is made up of 3 parts</p>
    <ol>
    <li> Kickass</li>
    <li>Badass</li>
    <li>Freekass</li>
    </ol>
